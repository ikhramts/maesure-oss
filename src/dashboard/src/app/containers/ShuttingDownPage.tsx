                Hey there, it's Iouri, creator of Maesure.
            </p>

            <p>
            I started work on Maesure as a side project almost two years ago with hope that it will help a lot of people.
            </p>

            <p>
                As it turns out, most people, including me, don't need Maesure. A lot of people have tried it, but few have stayed. So I moved on to other projects, but kept Maesure online to avoid disrupting the lives of those of you who stayed.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, Measure is not free to operate; it costs money and attention, and soon the desktop app will require a certificate renewal - an additional cost.
            </p>

            <p>
            So at this point, the only action that makes sense is to take Maesure offline.
            </p>

            <p>
            To those of you who are still using Maesure - I'm sorry to disrupt your lives with this, and a huge thanks for sticking with it despite its flaws.  
            </p>
            <p>
            To everyone else: thank you for giving Maesure a try, and for providing incredibly valuable feedback.
            </p>
